# logo-generator

## Description
This is a logo generator that I created using Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I learned a lot about classes and constructors and the four pillars of OOP, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphisim. 

## Installation 
You must install inquirer version 8.2.4.
Jest version 29.7.0 (for testing purposes only).

## Usage
Open using the bash command 'node index.js'. It will prompt you with four questions about your logo. Choose your logo text, text color, a shape and background color for your logo. 
Once you have answered the questions it will generate an svg file in the examples directory.
